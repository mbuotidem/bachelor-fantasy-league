# Testing the Contestant Management System

The contestant management system has been successfully implemented! Here's how to test it:

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll See
A grid of contestant cards you can click to flip and see bios, add/edit contestants, and toggle elimination status.

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit http://localhost:3000

### 2. Sign Up / Log In
- Create a new account or log in with existing credentials
- The authentication system is fully working

### 3. Create a League
- Click "Create League" button
- Fill out the league form (name, season, settings)
- Submit to create your league

### 4. Access Contestant Management
- Once you have a league, click the "View & Manage" button on any league card
- This will open the League Detail view
- Click on the "Contestants" tab (should be selected by default)

### 5. Test Contestant Features

#### Add Contestants (Commissioner Only)
- Click "Add Contestant" button
- Fill out the form:
  - Name (required)
  - Age, Hometown, Occupation (optional)
  - Bio (optional)
  - Profile Photo (optional - will show file upload)
- Submit to create the contestant

**Note**: If you see an S3 upload error, the system will fall back to using a preview URL so you can still test the functionality. To fix S3 uploads permanently, redeploy the backend with `npx ampx sandbox`.

#### View Contestant Cards
- See the grid of contestant cards
- Each card shows:
  - Profile photo (or default avatar)
  - Name, age, hometown, occupation
  - Points total
  - Elimination status

#### Flip Card Animation
- Click any contestant card to see the 3D flip animation
- Front: Basic info and photo
- Back: Bio and action buttons (if you're the commissioner)

#### Commissioner Actions (Back of Card)
- **Edit**: Opens the form pre-filled with contestant data
- **Eliminate**: Marks contestant as eliminated with confirmation
- **Restore**: Restores eliminated contestants
- **Delete**: Permanently removes contestant with confirmation

#### Search and Filter
- Use the search box to find contestants by name, hometown, or occupation
- Use the dropdown to filter by status (All, Active, Eliminated)

#### Visual Features
- Eliminated contestants have red styling and "ELIMINATED" overlay
- Cards are sorted by elimination status (active first) then by points
- Responsive grid layout that works on mobile and desktop
