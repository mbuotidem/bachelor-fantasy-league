# 🎯 Draft System Implementation Guide

The interactive draft system has been successfully implemented! Here's how it works and how to use it:

## 🚀 Access Through League Management

1. **Login** to your account on the main page
2. **Create or join a league** from the dashboard
3. **Click "View & Manage"** on any league card
4. **Navigate to the draft section** in the league management interface
5. **Create and start a draft** (commissioners only) or participate in an existing draft

**Note**: The draft system is integrated into the main league management flow - there is no standalone demo page.

## 📋 How to Use the Draft System

### For Commissioners:
1. **Create Draft**: Use the DraftService to create a draft for your league
2. **Start Draft**: Click "Start Draft" to begin the live draft (changes status from 'not_started' to 'in_progress')
3. **Restart Draft**: Use "Restart Draft" to reset all picks and randomize draft order
4. **Monitor Progress**: Watch as teams make their picks with real-time polling updates

### For Team Owners:
1. **Access Draft**: Navigate to the draft interface when a draft exists for your league
2. **Wait for Turn**: Watch the timer and turn indicators - your team roster appears in the left sidebar
3. **Make Picks**: Click on contestants when it's your turn (they'll have green borders and "CLICK TO DRAFT" labels)
4. **View Your Roster**: See your drafted contestants in the sidebar with pick details and images

## 🎮 Draft Flow

1. **League Created** → Commissioner can create draft using `draftService.createDraft()`
2. **Draft Created** → Status: 'not_started', randomized team order generated
3. **Draft Started** → Status: 'in_progress', timer begins, first team can pick
4. **Teams Take Turns** → Snake draft order, 2-minute timer per pick
5. **Picks Made** → Validation, roster updates, turn advances
6. **Draft Complete** → Status: 'completed' when all teams have 5 contestants

## 🎯 How to Make Picks

When it's your turn to draft:

1. **Look for Green Highlights** - Available contestants will have:
   - Green glowing borders
   - "🎯 CLICK TO DRAFT" labels
   - Bouncing animations
   - Dashed green borders

2. **Click Any Available Contestant** - Simply click on their card

3. **Confirm Your Pick** - A dialog will ask you to confirm

4. **Success!** - You'll see a confirmation message

When it's NOT your turn:
- Contestants will be grayed out
- You'll see "Wait Your Turn" labels
- The system shows whose turn it is
